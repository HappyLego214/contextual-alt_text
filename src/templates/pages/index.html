                Alt-text is important for making your website accessible to people with visual impairments. It provides a description of images, allowing screen readers to share the image’s content with users who can’t see it. Without alt-text, many people would miss out on understanding your images.

        <div class="about-alt-child-2">
            <span>
                Alt-text also helps with SEO. Search engines use it to understand what your images are about, which can improve your website’s ranking in search results. Cobalt makes it easy to create accurate, helpful alt-text, improving both accessibility and search visibility.

                    </h3>
                    <span>The ablation results for NLP Alt-Text generation evaluate the models' ability to generate alternative textual descriptions using three metrics: BLEU-4, METEOR, and ROUGE-L.
                        For BLEU-4, which measures n-gram precision between the generated and reference text, Bart performs the best with a score of 1.43, followed by FlanT5 and Pegasus, both with a score of 1.24. T5 scores slightly lower at 1.12. In METEOR, which assesses word matches and semantic similarity, Pegasus achieves the highest score of 8.3, followed by FlanT5 with 7.73 and T5 with 7.53. Bart scores the lowest at 7.17, indicating slightly less semantic alignment. For ROUGE-L, which evaluates fluency and structure by measuring the longest common subsequences, Pegasus scores the highest with 12.12, followed by FlanT5 at 11.43 and T5 with 11.1. Bart scores the lowest with 10.75.
                        In summary, Bart is best in BLEU-4, Pegasus excels in METEOR and ROUGE-L, while T5 lags behind in all three metrics.

                    </h3>
                    <span>In this section, the performance improvement of models when provided with both captions and summaries (Cap + Sum) is compared to when only summaries (Sum) are used. The "Difference" column represents the increase in performance when captions are added.
                        For BLEU-4, the average improvement is 1.37, indicating a modest gain when captions are included. T5 and FlanT5 see the highest improvement with 1.41, while Bart shows the least improvement with 1.29. In METEOR, the average difference is 9.18, showing a significant increase in semantic similarity when captions are added. Bart benefits the most with a gain of 10.46, while T5 experiences the least improvement with 7.78. For ROUGE-L, the average improvement is 9.09, reflecting enhanced fluency and coherence with the inclusion of captions. Bart again shows the largest gain with 10.23, while T5 has the smallest improvement at 8.55.
                        In summary, adding captions provides a noticeable improvement across all models, with Bart benefiting the most in METEOR and ROUGE-L, while T5 shows the smallest gains overall.

                        For BLEU-4, Bart achieves the highest score of 12.43, indicating superior accuracy in matching n-grams with context. FlanT5 follows with a score of 10.5, while T5 and Pegasus score much lower, both at 6.68. In METEOR, Bart outperforms all models with a score of 49.63, showing strong semantic alignment when context is provided. FlanT5 and Pegasus follow with scores of 44.71 and 34.92, respectively, while T5 scores the lowest at 34.67. For ROUGE-L, Bart excels with a score of 26.79, followed by FlanT5 at 23.09 and Pegasus at 17.77. T5 scores the lowest at 17.5, indicating its relative weakness in structural alignment.
                        In summary, Bart demonstrates the strongest performance across all metrics when provided with context, while T5 shows the weakest results, especially in terms of structural alignment.
