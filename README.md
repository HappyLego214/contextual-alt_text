# Contextual Alt-Text Generator üñºÔ∏èüìù

A research-driven tool to generate **context-aware alt-text** for images by combining object detection with contextual paragraph summarization. This project aims to improve accessibility by producing meaningful, descriptive alt-text based on the **image content** and its surrounding **textual context**.

## Inspiration

Traditional alt-text generation often lacks **contextual understanding**, leading to generic or unhelpful captions. This project builds on models like **ClipCap** and methods proposed in [Alt-Text with Context (arXiv:2305.14779)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14779), extending them by incorporating both image features and **contextual paragraph summaries** to generate better captions.
